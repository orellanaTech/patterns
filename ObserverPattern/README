OBSERVER PATTERN

    Defines a one-to-many relation between objects so when an object changes hsi state,
    all its dependents objects are notified and updated automatically

Tips

    - Subjects implements an interface in order to update Observers.
    - Observers are loosely coupled in that the Subject knows nothing about them,
      other than that they implement the Observer interface.
    - You can push or pull data from the Observable when using the pattern (pull is
      considered more “correct”).
    - Don’t depend on a specific order of notification for your Observers.

Example Implementation

    In the example there are the two types of notification, pull or push.
    With pull subject the observer have access to the data.
    With push subject the subject send the data with the notification.
