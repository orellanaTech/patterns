STRATEGY PATTERN

    The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
    encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy
    lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


Tips:

    - Create interface in order to be impemented for each strategy
    - The object that HAS the strategy can implement a setter for change dynamically th estrategy.


Example Implementation

    FlyBehavior is the interface for implement the differents flying startegies.
    QuakBehavior is the interface for implement the differents quaking startegies.
