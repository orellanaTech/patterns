FACTORY PATTERN

    There are two kinds of Factory Patterns, FactoryMethod and FactoryAbstract.

    Factory Method:

        The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets
        subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
        instantiation to subclasses.
        (NYPizzaStore and ChicagoPizzaStore create pizza method in the example)


    Abstract Factory

        Have an interface for create objects , letting to the subclass decide wich objects to instantiate.
        Have more decouple between the class that creates the objects to the obejcts to be created.
